# Beautiful Sunny

Sunny scripts that generate beautiful figures for the plotting cookbook,
inspired by https://beautiful.makie.org/dev/.

Format:
- Each script `<name>.jl` should write one output file `build/<name>.png`.
- Plotting scripts should run quickly in a warm Julia process (~seconds). 
- The purpose of this cookbook is to illustrate plotting functionality, not
  simulation functionality. Avoid long-running simulations by loading a
  precomputed data file. For example, the script `<name>.jl` may load a
  companion data file such as `<name>.jld2` or similar. That data, in turn, may
  be generated by a second script `<name>-simulation.jl`. Data files will be
  stored in the Git history, so try to keep file sizes reasonable (~ 1MB or
  smaller if possible).
