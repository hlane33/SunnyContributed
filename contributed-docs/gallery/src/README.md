Add Sunny scripts here to generate beautiful figures that can be included in a
plotting cookbook. Each script `<name>.jl` should write one output file
`build/<name>.png`. An automated build script will use these outputs to produce
documentation page that has a gallery of figure thumbnails. Inspired by
https://beautiful.makie.org/dev/.
