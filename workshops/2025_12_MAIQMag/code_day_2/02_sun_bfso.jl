# # 0. Introduction to the SU(_N_) formalism with Ba₂FeSi₂O₇
#
# Traditional classical and semiclassical approaches to spin systems start by
# placing an SU(2) coherent state on each site. An SU(2) coherent state may
# simply be thought of as a dipole, or as a state of a 2-level quantum system,
# that is, as a linear combination of combination of $\vert\uparrow\rangle$ and
# $\vert\downarrow\rangle$ states.

# The idea behind the SU(_N_) generalization of this approach is to instead put
# an SU(_N_) coherent state on each site. This is equivalent to having a state
# from an _N_-level system on each site, for example, some linear combination of
# $\vert\frac{N-1}{2}\rangle$, $\vert\frac{N-2}{2}\rangle$, $\ldots$, $\vert\frac{-(N-1)}{2}\rangle$.
# The expectation of any relevant operator (including the dipole operators) can
# always be evaluated by taking an expectation value in this coherent state, as
# we will demonstrate concretely below.

# The chief advantage of this approach is that enables a richer description of
# the local physics. In particular, non-magnetic states can be represented
# directly and the physics of single-ion anisotropies can be modeled more
# faithfully. A useful showcase for this formalism the the square lattice
# antiferromagnet Ba₂FeSi₂O₇. This is is a quasi-2D system with effective $S=2$
# and strong easy-plane anisotropy. BFSO (as we will refer to it) has been
# studied using the SU(_N_) formalism in a number of recent studies, in
# particular the following:

# # 1. Anisotropies and large spins 
#
# Before specifying the complete Hamiltonian, we'll consider a cartoon picture
# of the single-ion physics. The Hamiltonian for a single $S=2$ spin with single
# ion anisotropy is simply $\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{SI}} = D(\hat{S}^z)^2$, where
# $\hat{S}^z$ is in the $S=2$ representation. We can use Sunny to represent this
# as a matrix.

## Import relevant libraries 
using Sunny, GLMakie, LinearAlgebra, Statistics

S = spin_matrices(2)  # Returns a vector of Sx, Sy, Sz
Sx, Sy, Sz = S        # Julia's "unpacking" syntax
## EXERCISE: Write the single-ion anisotropy (with D=1) and call it H_SI
## EXERCISE: How would you add a Zeeman term?

H_SI = Sz^2  # + h*μB*g*Sz

# The result is a diagonal matrix. Ordering of the basis elements is simply
# $\vert 2\rangle$, $\vert 1\rangle$, $\vert 0\rangle$, $\vert -1\rangle$, and
# $\vert -2\rangle$. Clearly the ground state is the $\vert 0 \rangle$, which
# is a non-magnetic state as we can quickly verify. First we'll write a complex
# vector to represent the ground state:

Z = [0., 0, 1 + 0im, 0, 0]

# We can now use this to evaluate the expectation values of the dipole operators.
expectation(op, Z) = real(Z' * op * Z)
sx = expectation(Sx, Z) 
sy = expectation(Sy, Z) 
sz = expectation(Sz, Z) 

# This is obviously a non-magnetic state that cannot be represented as a
# classical dipole of fixed length $S$. The SU(_N_) formalism provides a way for
# modeling states like these and calculating their dynamics. To see this in
# action, we'll make a spin system with only this single-ion anisotropy and no
# other interactions. We'll start by constructing a primitive tetragonal
# lattice.

# # 5. Spin waves
#
# A conceptually useful way to think of linear spin wave theory is as the
# quantization of classical dynamics linearized about the ground state. An
# important point is that for an S=1/2 spin, it is not possible to have
# longitudinal oscillations classically -- the classical magnitude has a fixed
# value of S. Similarly, at the linear level, there are no longitudinal
# oscillations in a traditional SWT calculation -- one has to incorporate 1/S
# corrections to recover such behavior. In the SU(_N_) generalization, the
# "spin" has additional degrees of freedom, corresponding to, for example,
# higher-order moments like quadrupoles and octupoles. As a consequence, 
# the dipole does not have a fixed magnitude. We can illustrate this aspect of
# the SU(_N_) classical dynamics with a simple animation.

# # 6. S(q,ω) with classical dynamics
#
# We noted above that the longitudinal mode should actually decay, an effect
# that can only be captured when going beyond linear SWT by adding 1-loop
# corrections. While this is a planned future for Sunny, we note for now that
# some of these effects can be capture in finite-temperature simulations using
# the classical dynamics. Intuitively, this is possible because the classical
# dynamics is never linearized, unlike LSWT, so "magnon-magnon" interactions are
# included up to arbitrary order.
#
# In this next section, we'll calculate 𝒮(q,ω) using the generalized classical
# dynamics, examining the exact same path through reciprocal space, only this
# time we'll perform the simulation at T > 0. To start with, we'll make another
# BFSO system. This time, however, we'll need a large unit cell, rather than a
